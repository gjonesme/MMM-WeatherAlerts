# MMM-WeatherAlert Module Weather Provider Development Documentation

For now, only openweathermap is supported as a weather alert provider.

Kept the same weather provider format as the core MagicMirror2 weather module to allow additional weather data providers to be setup if the support weather alert data and potentially for easy integration with the core weather module in the future.

For how to develop your own weather provider, please check the [MagicMirrorÂ² documentation](https://docs.magicmirror.builders/development/weather-provider.html).
